# Creativity Support Tools Accelerating Discovery and Innovation 
###### Ben Shneiderman

## SUMMARY

This article talked about creativity support tools.

It firstly introduced some historical background of creativity support tools.

Then it defined three different kinds of people who define creativity differently:

**Structuralists**

These people like everything to be organized.

**Inspirationalists**

These people, on the contrary, don't like structures. They like to meditate and dreaming.

This kind of people reminds me of Steve Jobs.

**Situationalists**

These people believe creative work needs commmunication and collaboration and interaction between people.

Then this article said *Developers*, *Product managers* and *Researchers* all need to change their mindsets to encourage creativity-related research.

Then the article discussed some design principles for creativity support tools, including:

* Support exploratory search
* Enable collaboration
* Provide rich history-keeping
* Design with low thresholds, high ceilings, and wide walls

The last part of this article is about research methods. I did not even read this part, because the previous parts have successfully killed me.

## COMMENT

This article is too 'general' and too abstract. It is full of 泛泛而谈 and looks like a philosophic preach to me. It is a guideline of how we should create tools that supports creativity with no concrete information that helps me digest the author's idea.

The authors English language using seems great because the article looks more like a literature article than a technical document to me, and thus hard to understand.

In summary, I don't like this article. I could not extract usefulness from this article.
