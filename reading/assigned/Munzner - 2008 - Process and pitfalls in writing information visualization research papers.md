## SUMMARY
### Introduction
This 

### Initial Stage - Paper Types
In this part the author introduced 6 types of infovis papers and suggested considering where we want a research project to end.

#### Technique
Technique papers write about novel algorithms and implement them.

This kind of paper needs to use algorithm complexity analysis, quantitative timing measurements of the implementation, a qualitative discussion of images created by this new algorithm, or quantitative metrics of image quality as validation.

It is a good practice to compare the results against those from competing algorithms.

#### Design Study
Design Study papers write about new designs of visual representation for a particular domain problem.

In this kind of paper, an author needs to first explain the target problem, then state the design requirements determined through task analysis, before justify these design choices by showing how they fulfill the requirements. The fourth thing to do is to present results that back up the claim that this new approach is better than others (e.g. case studies or scenarios of use).

The contribution of a design study is usually not a new algorithm or technique, but a well-reasoned justification of how existing techniques can be combined in a useful way.

#### Systems
Systems papers focus on the architectural choices made in the design of an infrastructure, framework, or toolkit. Typically, no new technique/algorithm is introduced in a systems paper, so is new design for an application solving a specific problem.

#### Evaluation
Evaluation papers assess how an infovis system or technique helps target users.

The most common approach in infovis is formal user studies, where tasks are abstracted and can be quantitatively measured in terms of time and accuracy and analyzed with statistical methods. A different approach is field studies.

#### Model
Model papers present formalisms and abstractions as opposed to the design or evaluation of any particular technique or system.

Subcategory of model papers include:
* Taxonomy
* Formalism
* Commentary

#### Combinations
The last type of paper is a mixture of previous types.

#### Type Pitfalls
Some pitfalls need to avoid in the initial stage are:
* *Design in Technique's Clothing:* validate a new design by providing only performance measurements;
* *Application Bingo versus Design Study:* apply some random technique to a new problem without thoroughly thinking if the technique is suitable;
* *All That Coding Means I Deserve A Systems Paper:* write a systems paper only because of significant coding efforts;
* *Neither Fish Nor Fowl:* try to put paper in multiple categories.

### Middle Pitfalls: Visual Encoding
A major concern in the middle stage is whether visual encoding choices are appropriate and justifiable. In this stage there also are some pitfalls:
* *Unjustified Visual Encoding:*
* *Hammer In Search Of Nail:*
* *2D Good, 3d Better:*
* *Color Cacophony:*
* *Rainbows Just Like In The Sky:*

### Late Pitfalls: Paper Strategy, Tactics, and Results
#### Strategy Pitfalls
* *What I Did Over My Summer Vacation*
* *Least Publishable Unit*
* *Dense As Plutonium*
* *Bad Slice and Dice*

#### Tactical Pitfalls
* *Stealth Contributions:*
* *I am So Unique:*
* *Enumeration Without Justification:*
* *Sweeping Assertions:*
* *I Am Utterly Perfect:*

#### Results Pitfalls
* *Unfettered By Time:*
* *Fear and Loathing of Complexity:*
* *Straw Man Comparison:*
* *Tiny Toy Datasets:*
* *But My Friends Liked It:*
* *Unjustified Tasks:*

### Final Pitfalls: Style and Submission
#### Writing Style Pitfalls
* *Deadly Detail Dump:*
* *Story-Free Captions:*
* *My Picture Speaks For Itself:*
* *Grammar is Optional:*
* *Mistakes Were Made:*
* *Jargon Attack:*
* *Nonspecific Use of Large:*

#### Submission Pitfalls
* *Slimy Simultaneous Submission:*
* *Resubmit Unchanged:*

### Pitfalls By Generality
The author defined *infovis* as visualizations for which spatial representation is chosen, and *scivis* when spatial representation is given. Based on these definitions, the author then summarized the generality of pitfalls discussed:
* First stage pitfalls are specific to infovis;
* Visual encoding pitfalls are specific to visualization. *Color Cacophony* and *Rainbows Just Like In The Sky* pertain to both infovis and scivis. *Unjustified Visual Encoding*, *Hammer In Search Of Nail*, and *2D Good, 3D Better* focus on issues that are more central for an infovis audience, but may well be of benefit to scivis as well;
* Strategy pitfalls pertain to any research paper;
* Tactical pitfalls are very general;
* Result pitfalls hold for all visualization papers, and *Straw Man Comparison* is general enough for all research papers;
* Final pitfalls are very general, except for *Story-Free Captions*, which is specific to both visualization and computer graphics and *My Picture Speaks For Itself*, which is most tuned for infovis, but certainly may pique the interest of the scivis community.

## COMMENT

This paper is a wonderful work. It gave me a lot of insights while, and after, reading.

I only had a vague idea about questions like 'what should a paper include', 'how to make a paper more influential'. This paper provided me with a systematic, well-organized classification of infovis papers. Each contained detailed explanation and examples.

Although this paper is about how to write a research paper, but because every paper is a summary, a conclusion, a report of a research project or a part of a research project, this paper is actually a guidance of research itself.

I believe that there are cases where people did a good research project but did not reflect it very well in their papers, but I believe more that a bad paper comes from a failed research project.

In summary, to avoid pitfalls in writing research papers, the most important thing to do is to keep these pitfalls in mind and avoid them when conducting research. (Maybe except for Final Pitfalls, which are merely for writing papers, rather than for doing research)
