## SUMMARY
### Introduction
This paper presented a nested four-layer model for the visualization design and validation.

The four levels are:

* characterize tasks and data in the vocabulary of the problem domain (characterization)
* abstract into operations and data types (abstraction)
* design visual encoding and interaction techniques (design)
* create algorithms to execute these techniques efficiently (implementation)

The main contribution of this model is to give guidance on what evaluation methodology is appropriate to validate each of these different kinds of design choices. The author break threats to validity down into four categories:

* wrong problem
* wrong abstraction
* wrong encoding/interaction
* wrong algorithm

The secondary contribution is three recommendations to visualization researchers.

### Nested Model
#### Domain Problem and Data Characterization
#### Operation and Data Type Abstraction
#### Visual Encoding and Interaction Design
#### Algorithm Design

### Threats and Validation
*immediate* and *downstream* validation approaches

#### Domain Threats
#### Abstraction Threats
#### Encoding and Interaction Threats
#### Algorithm Threats
#### Mismatches

### Examples
This paper provided multiple example papers, each with detailed description and a figure that showed its validation methods in context of the four-layer model.

### Comparison to Other Models

### Recommendations

* authors who make contributions at multiple levels should clearly distinguish between them;
* authors should clearly state what assumptions they make for levels upstream of their focus;
* the visualization community would benefit from more papers that focus on problem characterization.

## COMMENT
This paper is of great help to me. It is well-organized and follows the guideline the author proposed [1].

Some examples that shows how this paper be a good example in paper writing are as below:

* *Sweeping Assertions:* In **Introduction**, the author explicitly stated 'conjecture' when making an observation.
* *Stealth Contributions:* In **Introduction**, the author explicitly stated the main contribution and the secondary contribution of this paper.
* *Mistakes Were Made:* In the whole paper, the author avoided using the passive voice.
