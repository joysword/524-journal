## SUMMARY
This paper presented an integrated GIS tool called Accessibility Analyst.

Section 2 introduced different types of accessibility measures:

* opportunity-based measures
* gravity-type measures
* utility-based measures
* space-time measures

Section 3 is about accessibility analysis and GIS. Accessibility analysis involves developing or selecting appropriate accessibility measures based on the nature of the planning issues and the purpose of the analysis. An accessibility measure is specified by several parameters:

* the spatial unit for analysis
* the socioeconomic groups whose accessibility is to be assessed
* the type of opportunities
* the mode of travel
* the origins and destinations
* the attractiveness of the destinations
* the travel impedance

It then discussed some of the strengths and some of the limits of GIS in accessibility analysis. This answered the question 'why Accessibility Analyst is necessary and important'.

In Section 4, functionality of Accessibility Analyst was presented. It is actually an extension to ArcView. It provides a set of accessibility measures that users can select to use. It works with other extensions such as *Spatial Analyst*, *Network Analyst*, *Patch Analyst* and *3D Analyst* to provide an integrated GIS environment for accessibility analysis.

Data-preparation functions include:

* Get Polygon Centroid
* Get Points' Centroid
* Find Nearest Point on Network

Travel-impedance measurement functions include:

* Straight-line Distance Matrix
* Shortest-Path Distance Matrix
* Network Distance Matrix
* Network Time Matrix
* Network Cost Matrix
* Matrices Operation

None of the travel-impedance measurement functions in Accessibility Analyst takes into account the speed limits of network links and the effect of turn restrictions and directionality.

Accessibility measurement functions include:

* Catchment Profile Analysis
* Cumulative-Opportunity Measure
* Potential Model
* Double Constrained Potential Model
* Modified Potential Model
* Utility Based Measure

Visualization functions include:

* Location Profile Chart
* Cumulative Profile Chart
