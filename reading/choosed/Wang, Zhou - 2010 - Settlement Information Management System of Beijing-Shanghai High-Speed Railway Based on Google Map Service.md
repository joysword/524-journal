Wang, Y., & Zhou, W. (2010). Settlement Information Management System of Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Based on Google Map Service. In *2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)* (pp. 2326–2329). IEEE. doi:10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649729

## COMMENT
This is similar to Zhang 2010 [1], in that it also makes use of techniques such as Google Map Service, XML, Ajax.

The major difference is in the front-end. The snapshots look interesting, but the author failed to discuss the front-end at all.

### For STAR report
This article will have at most a mention, probably it will only appear in reference.
