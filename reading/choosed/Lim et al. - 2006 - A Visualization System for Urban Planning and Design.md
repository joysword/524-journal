## SUMMARY
This paper introduced Town-Maker, a landscape visualization system using VRML and plant modeling techniques to generate virtual reality image of urban landscape.

It allows user to set parameters for houses, buildings and town. For houses, user can set `number of houses` and `size`; for buildings, user can set `number of buildings` and `size` and `story`; for town, a series of parameters can be set to configure the layout of the landscape, see figures below.

[VRML image made by Town-Maker]

Based on these parameters, it then generates a 3D image of the landscape.

A simple test was conducted to validate the usefulness of the system.

## COMMENT

### For STAR report

This article is not very new, written in 2006. But it showed an interesting application of visualization/VR in urban planning.

I should definitely include this work or newer contribution in this direction, if any, to my STAR report.

### For future work
For now I've only built 2D visualizations for urban planning. It would be interesting if some 3D visualization or VR application can be built in CAVE for urban planning community.
