# Challenges and Unsolved Problems
###### Robert S. Laramee and Robert Kosara

## SUMMARY

### Introducation

This material is a book chapter. It is written in 2006, and published in 2007, which means the situation it described was less than a decade ago. At that time, visualization community was under a dramatic shift, which produces pervasive new directions of research. The author thought it was time for them to come up with a more comprehensive (than before) list of top unsolved problems to direct future evolution in this field.

This chapter is a survey of future challenges and unsolved problems that previously mentioned a lot in visualization literature as well as a summary of grand issues discovered from their own experience. The authors divided visualization challenges into three categories:

* Human-Centered Challenges
* Technical Challenges
* Financial Challenges

Although there are various sources from which the authors learned about cl assification of future challenges, the main resources that were repeated throughout the chapter was from Chaomei Chen [1], Bill Hibbard [2] and Thomas and Cook [3].

### Human-Centered Challenges

Human-centered challenges are with a focus on people.

#### Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Visualization research is not the purpose. It is the method. It is the method by which a user can have insight from abstract data. The user, in most cases, are not computer scientists. This makes it important for visualization researchers to communicate with practitioners in other disciplines.

#### Evaluation of Usability

#### Finding the Most Effective Visual Metaphors

#### Choosing Optimal Levels of Visual Abstraction

#### Collaborative Visualization

#### Effective Interaction

#### Representing Data Quality

### Technical Challenges

Technicall challenges are with a focus on computer.

#### Scalability and Large Data Management

#### High Data Dimensionality and Time-Dependent Data

#### Data Filtering

#### Cross-Platform Visualization

### Financial Challenges

Financial Challenges are with a focus on money.

#### Evaluating Effectiveness and Utility in Practice

#### Introducing Standards and Benchmarks

#### From Research Into Practice

### Other Challenges

There are other challenges identified but not included into above three categories

* Improving Visual Quality
* Integrating Virtual with Physical Reality
* Integrating Probelm Solving Environments
* Developing a Theory of Visualization
* A *Priori* Knowlege
* Improving Aesthetics
* Privacy and Security

### Predictions

The authors also made a prediction about to what extent each of the categorized challenges can be solved in 20 years.

They concluded that *Interdisciplinary Collaboration*, *Finding Effective Visual Metaphors*, *Representing Data Quality* and *Transforming Research Into Practice* will be solved in 20 years, while *Evaluation of Usability*, *Choosing Optimal Levels of Abstraction*, *Effective Interaction*, *Scalability and Large Data Management*, *High Data Dimensioinality and Time-Dependent Data*, *Data Filtering*, *Platform Independent Visuualization*, *Evaluating Effectiveness and Utility* and *Introducing Standards and Benchmarks* will not be solved in 20 years.
