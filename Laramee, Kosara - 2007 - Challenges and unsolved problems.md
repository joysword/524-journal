# Challenges and Unsolved Problems
###### Robert S. Laramee and Robert Kosara

This material is a book chapter. It is written in 2006, and published in 2007, which means the situation it described was less than a decade ago. At that time, visualization community was under a dramatic shift, which produces pervasive new directions of research. The author thought it was time for them to come up with a more comprehensive (than before) list of top unsolved problems to direct future evolution in this field.

This chapter is a survey of future challenges and unsolved problems that previously mentioned a lot in visualization literature as well as a summary of grand issues discovered from their own experience. The authors divided visualization challenges into three categories:

* Human-Centered Challenges
* Technical Challenges
* Financial Challenges

Although there are various sources from which the authors learned about cl assification of future challenges, the main resources that were repeated throughout the chapter was from Chaomei Chen [1], Bill Hibbard [2] and Thomas and Cook [3].

### Human-Centered Challenges
