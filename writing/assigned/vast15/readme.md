3. added more background information to give readers a clearer understanding of relathionship between each work we discussed. (as suggested by reviewer [TODO: who])
4. removed content that is not a good fit to a state-of-the-art report, such as 太简单的 system built upon Google APIs and [urban rescue system]. (as suggested by reviewer [TODO: who])
5. shortened content about one specific study on urban simulation so that more thorough overview of the field can be fit into the limited length of paper.
