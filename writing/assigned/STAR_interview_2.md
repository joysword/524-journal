* **What are the main research project(s) you work on?**

In general, my research focuses on **urban environmental planning**. I have three ongoing projects: (1) modeling the sustainability, resilience, and stability of urban systems in a metabolism framework (e.g., categorizing inputs and outputs of urban systems); (2) modeling food waste generation volume and recovery/reuse opportunities in urban neighborhoods; (3) investigating how healthcare sector can reduce greenhouse emissions through sustainable transportation programs.

* **What would be an ideal result from the project(s)?**

Ideal outcomes would be deliverables that can benefit researchers, practitioners, and general public. That means the results should be publishable, transferable and replicable in other studies and regions, and accessible to the public.

* **What kind of data do you work with most often in your research?**

Most often we use data on demography, land use, economy, ecology, and environment at various geographic and temporal scales.

* **How do you gather or generate this data?**

We collect data from various government agencies, industry/market reports, as well as research publications, through online data/ literature reviews, formal surveys, and personal communications.

* **How is this data used/analyzed?**

Data may be aggregated or disaggregated using spatial and statistical analyses. Advanced models may also need to be developed for environmental and socioeconomic impact analyses.

* **What visualization tools/techniques do you use to help make sense of this data?**

ArcGIS Spatial Analyst/Network Analysis, MS Excel and Access.

* **What visualization tools/techniques do you use to display the data and/or communicate with other experts in your field?**

ArcGIS, Photoshop, Adobe suites.
