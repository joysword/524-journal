* **What are the main research project(s) you work on?**

Application of complexity theory to civil systems to uncover emerging and inherent properties that will ultimately lead to recommendations for more sustainable and resilient cities.

* **What would be an ideal result from the project(s)?**

Depiction of clear complex properties that impact energy use and that can be actuated to reduce overall energy consumption.

* **What kind of data do you work with most often in your research?**

Spatial data on infrastructure systems, climate data, and behavior / consumption data by individual / households or aggregated by zones.

* **How do you gather or generate this data?**

Relevant authorities including city open data portals (e.g., Chicago Open Data), federal government agencies (e.g., Census Bureau, Energy Information Administration), open access platforms (e.g., openstreetmap), international organizations (e.g., World Bank).

* **How is this data used/analyzed?**

Displayed as GIS maps, turned into networks (e.g., using python igraph library), analyzed statistically.

* **What visualization tools/techniques do you use to help make sense of this data?**

Mainly: ArcGIS, Gephi, matplotlib (python), JavaScript (D3 library).

* **What visualization tools/techniques do you use to display the data and/or communicate with other experts in your field?**

Same as question 6.
