* **What are the main research project(s) you work on?**

I work on questions of travel behavior, access, and the economic outcomes for people that are linked with the provision of transportation.

The ideal would be to be able to influence transportation policy that is consistent with travel behavior and decisions that allow for equitable access to opportunities.

* **What kind of data do you work with most often in your research?**

I work with Census data, travel behavior data (such as Travel Tracker collected by CMAP, or Travel Behavior Inventory collected by Metro Council (Minnesota)), LEHD, Census CTPP. I have also collected data through surveys when needed.

* **How do you gather or generate this data?**

Most are available through online portals by the collecting agency.

The data is used to do empirical work. Questions of choice are analyzed as a function of cost, service availability, land use, and other variables.

Mostly statistical software to do plots and graphs. Another example is what we did for the accessibility project.
