## What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to build a tool that shows some accessibility data on a map that domain scientists can interact with to find insights. Accessibility here means the cumulative number of land use that is reachable in a certain period of time.

## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, to investigate accessibility data, domain scientists uses GIS software such as ArcMaps or ArcGIS.

## What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
In our approach, we calculate travel time matrix. Based on it, we do accessibility calculation. And we visualize accessibility on the map. The reason behind its potential success is that this tool saves urban planners' time to process data. It does all the calculation and cumulation necessary and shows directly the final result to urban planners.

## Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
Urban planners and researchers will be the ones who benefit from this tool. Upon success of this project, domain scientists will be able to collect information about a variety of accessibility in Chicago area in a much shorter time than they currently need. Besides making their work easier, this tool will potentially allow users to obtain new findings and reach new conclusions through our visualization.

## What are the risks and the payoffs?
The risk is that our tool is not useful to urban planners and researchers. The payoff is that they have a good tool to provide insight in accessibility condition in Chicago area.

## How much will it cost? How long will is take?
It will be free to use. It will take very short time for the urban planning to use this tool, because we will be serving the web-based tool on our server.

## What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
I think the midterm "exam" of this project can be a survey to domain scientists to see their opinion towards a prototype we build. Ideal feedback would be encouraging responses as well as optimistic ones.

The final "exam" of this project will be a qualitative user study in which urban planners interact with the full version of this tool and try to find insight using it. Ideal outcome would be participants stating the tool helps them to investigate the thing faster and better.

An alternative final "exam" could be a quantitative user study, where two different sets of users are given the same typical accessibility analysis tasks. One set of participants would doing these tasks in traditional ways, using GIS software, spreadsheets and other tools, while the other set of participants would use our tool to do these tasks. Ideal result would be that there are significant differences in how fast the tasks are done, how accurate the tasks are done, and how much of the tasks are done.
