###### instructor: Prof. Angus Forbes

### Coding

It contains code I write, if any, for this course.

### Reading

It does not contain reading materials. It would a waste of space to upload those `pdf`s to Github.  
Instead, it contains writing for reading.

### Writing

It contains writing for everything else. E.g. for my own project.
